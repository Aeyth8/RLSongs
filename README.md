# RLSongs
There are no publicly released lists that displayed what files were which songs, until now.

A super simple GUI to delete / remove specific songs from your Rocket League directory.

**WIP**

## Key Features

- Automated File Removal For Updates / File Verification (WIP)

- Click And Clack Display

- Song Search Bar

## Why Use This?

This is a much easier approach compared to searching the files and deleting them yourself, you *COULD* use a bat file to remove any song IDs you've manually added and run it each time an update occurs, something I've been doing myself.

However this will make things much easier, and other than that it doesn't really matter, just a fun project I'm making for myself to learn coding and improve my skills.
